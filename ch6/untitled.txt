Text a sequence of characters. Text recognition is closely associated with pattern recognition.

used in : document classification, sentiment analyses, author identification , QA projects.

vecotorizing text for deep learning :
    1. Segment text into words, transform word into a vector
    2. Segment text into character and transform
    3. Extract n-grams of words or characters, and transform each n-gram into a vector. Ngramgs are overlapping groups of multiple consecutive characters.
    
different units we break down characters/words are called as tokens

two ways to fed into deep neural network: 
1. hot encoding 
2. token embedding

bag of words is synonymous with bag of grams (as in n-gram). its not a order preserving method of tokenisation
