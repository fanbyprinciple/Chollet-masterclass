The rest of the theory just vanished in thin air but the thing is the book is quite important.

feature engineering is manually finding features for classification.

ImageDataGenerator is used to create more training data by trandforming the current training data.

a pretrained network is a network that was typically trained on a largenetwork.

The author covers VGG16 architecture.

Two ways to use a pretrained network-
1. feature extraction
2. fine-tuning

feature extraction: in CNN, before we flatten and use dense layer the layersabove it are known as convolutional base.

we dont retain the dense layers, because convolutional base are more generic features, since in dense layers they loose all features that affect space.
